Deploying an application to Heroku involves several steps, including setting up a Heroku account, installing the Heroku CLI, preparing your application, and finally deploying it. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

---

# How to Deploy to Heroku

## Prerequisites

-   A Heroku account. If you don't have one, sign up at [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/).
-   [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) installed on your local machine.

## Step 1: Log In to Heroku

Open your terminal and log in to Heroku using the CLI:

```bash
heroku login
```

A web browser will open, prompting you to log in to your Heroku account.

## Step 2: Create a New Heroku App

Navigate to your project directory and create a new Heroku app:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
heroku apps:create <your-app-name>
```

This command will create a new Heroku app and link it to your project. You will see a URL for your new Heroku app.
You might need to visit the link if failed to create and fill in your payment method.

## Step 3: Add the nginx Buildpack

```bash
heroku buildpacks:add heroku-community/nginx -a <your-app-name>
```

## Step 4: Deploy Your Application

### Push to Heroku

```bash
git push heroku main
```

Heroku will build and deploy your application. You can see the progress in the terminal.

## Step 5: Open Your Deployed Application

Once the deployment is complete, you can open your application in the browser:

```bash
heroku open
```

## Step 6: Manage Environment Variables

If your application requires environment variables, you can set them using the Heroku CLI. For example:

```bash
heroku config:set VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-mapbox-api-key>
```
